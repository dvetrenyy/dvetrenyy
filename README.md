- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Danya Vetrenyy (@dvetrenyy) // (he/him) but I'm ok with any pronouns honestly, this are just ones that I'm used to
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming languages and languages in general as well as game development
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python at my university (I'm studing for "fundametal and applied linguistics bechelor" in SUSU, Russia)
and I'm also self-educating in C/C++, Rust, JavaScript and Julia.
Also I learn gamedev stuff mainly related to Godot Engine (and I'm a Game-Maker-guy in past as well) 
- ðŸ“« If for whatever reasons you want to contact me, here's how you can do it:
- â€” f3wrvl + either @gmail.com and @mail.ru
- â€” @windless_mill on Twitter (though I'm now visit it rarely enough since Twitter is blocked in my country)
- â€” @windless_mill on Telegram (the most recommended, I guess)
- â€” @f3wrvl on VK
